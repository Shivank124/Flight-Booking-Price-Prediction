# Flight-Booking-Price-Prediction  
I worked on a Flight-Booking Price Prediction project where I performed data analysis and built a machine learning model to predict prices. I used linear regression, decision tree regressor, and random forest regressor algorithms to train the model. The model achieved an R2 score of 98.49%. To prepare the data for the model, I used labelencoder to convert categorical data and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for feature selection.  

The project involved the following tasks:  
Data cleaning and preprocessing  
Exploratory data analysis  
Feature engineering  
Model selection and training  
Model evaluation  
  
I am proud of the work I did on this project and the results I achieved. It was a great opportunity to apply my data analysis and machine learning skills to a real-world problem.
